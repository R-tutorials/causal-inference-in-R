DAGs depict causal relationships. In this DAG, the assumption is that `x` causes `y`.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-dag-basic-1.png){#fig-dag-basic width=288}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we're interested in the causal effect of `x` on `y`, we're trying to estimate a numeric representation of that arrow.\nUsually, though, there are many other variables and arrows in the causal structure of a given question.\nA series of arrows is called a *path*.\nThere are three types of paths you'll see in DAGs: forks, chains, and colliders (sometimes called inverse forks).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three types of causal relationships: forks, chains, and colliders. The direction of the arrows and the relationships of interest dictate which type of path a series of variables is. Forks represent a mutual cause, chains represent direct causes, and colliders represent mutual descendants.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-dag-path-types-1.png){#fig-dag-path-types width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nForks represent a common cause of two variables.\nHere, we're saying that `q` causes both `x` and `y`.\nThis is the traditional definition of a confounder.\nThey're called forks because the arrows from `x` to `y` are in different directions.\nChains, on the other hand, represent a series of arrows going in the same direction.\nHere `q` is called a *mediator*: it is along the causal path from `x` to `y`.\nIn this diagram, the only path from `x` to `y` is the one mediated through `q`.\nFinally, a collider is a path where two arrowheads meet at a variable.\nBecause causality always goes forward in time, this naturally means that the collider variable is caused by two other variables.\nHere, we're saying that `x` and `y` both cause `q`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Are DAGs SEMs?\n\nIf you're familiar with structural equation models (SEMs), a modeling technique commonly used in psychology and other social science settings, you may notice some similarities between SEMs and DAGs.\nIn fact, DAGs are a form of *non-parametric* SEM.\nSEMs estimate entire graphs using parametric assumptions.\nCausal DAGs, on the other hand, don't estimate anything; an arrow going from one variable to another says nothing about the strength or functional form of that relationship, only that we think it exists.\n:::\n\nOne of the major benefits of DAGs is that they help us identify sources of bias and, often, provide clues in how to address them.\nHowever, talking about an unbiased effect estimate only makes sense when we have a specific causal question in mind.\nSince each arrow represents a cause, it's causality all the way down, so no individual arrow is inherently problematic.\nHere, we're interested in the effect of `x` on `y`.\nThis question defines which paths we're interested in and which we're not.\n\nThese three types of paths have different implications for the statistical relationship between `x` and `y`.\nIf we only look at the correlation between the two variables under these assumptions:\n\n1.  In the fork, `x` and `y` will be associated, despite there being no arrow from `x` to `y`.\n2.  In the chain, `x` and `y` are related but only through `q`.\n3.  In the collider, `x` and `y` will *not* be related.\n\nPaths that transmit association are called *open paths*.\nPaths that do not transmit association are called *closed paths*.\nForks and chains are open while colliders are closed.\n\nSo, should we adjust for `q`?\nThat depends on the nature of the path.\nForks are confounding paths.\nBecause `q` causes both `x` and `y`, `x` and `y` will have a spurious association.\nThey both contain information from `q`, their mutual cause, and that mutual causal relationship makes `x` and `y` associated statistically.\nAdjusting for `q` will *block* the bias from confounding and give us the true relationship between `x` and `y`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Adjustment\n\nWe can use a variety of techniques to account for a variable.\nWe use the term \"adjustment\" to generally refer to any technique that removes the effect of variables we're not interested in.\n:::\n\n@fig-confounder-scatter depicts this effect visually.\nHere, `x` and `y` are continuous, and by definition of the DAG, they are unrelated.\n`q`, however, causes both.\nThe unadjusted effect is biased because it includes information about the open path from `x` to `y` via `z`.\nWithin levels of `z`, however, `x` and `y` are unrelated.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-confounder-scatter-1.png){#fig-confounder-scatter width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor chains, whether or not we adjusting for mediators depends on the research question.\nHere, adjusting for `q` would result in a null estimate of the effect of `x` on `y`.\nBecause the only effect of `x` on `y` is via `q`, no other effect remains.\nThe effect of `x` on `y` mediated by `q` is called the *indirect* effect, while the effect of `x` on `y` directly is called the *direct* effect.\nIf we're only interested in the direct effect, controlling for `q` might be what we want.\nIf we want to know about both effects, we shouldn't try to adjust for `q`.\nWe'll learn more estimating different mediation effects in @sec-mediation.\n\n@fig-mediator-scatter shows this effect visually.\nThe unadjusted effect of `x` on `y` represents the total effect.\nSince the total effect is due entirely to the path mediated by `q`, when we adjust for `q`, no relationship remains.\nThis is the direct effect.\nNeither of these effects is due to bias but rather each answers a different research question.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-mediator-scatter-1.png){#fig-mediator-scatter width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nColliders are different.\nIn the collider DAG of @fig-dag-path-types, `x` and `y` are *not* associated, but both cause `q`.\nAdjusting for `q` has the opposite effect than with confounding: it *opens* a biasing pathway.\nSometimes, people draw the path opened up by conditioning on a collider connecting `x` and `y`.\n\nVisually, we can see this happen when `x` and `y` are continuous and `q` is binary.\nIn @fig-collider-scatter, when we don't include `q`, we find there is no relationship between `x` and `y`.\nThat's the correct result.\nHowever, when we include `q`, we can detect information about both `x` and `y`, and they appear correlated: across levels of `x`, those with `q = 0` have lower levels of `y`.\nAssociation seemingly flows back in time.\nOf course, that can't happen from a causal perspective, so controlling for `q` is the wrong thing to do.\nWe end up with a biased effect of `x` on `y`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-collider-scatter-1.png){#fig-collider-scatter width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow can this be?\nSince `x` and `y` happen before `q`, `q` can't have an impact on them.\nLet's turn the DAG on its side and consider @fig-collider-time.\nIf we break down the two time points, at time point 1, `q` hasn't happened yet, and `x` and `y` are unrelated.\nAt time point 2, `q` happens due to `x` and `y`.\nBut causality only goes forward in time.\n`q` happening later can't change the fact that `x` and `y` happened independently at time point 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-collider-time-1.png){#fig-collider-time width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCausality only goes forward.\nAssociation, however, is time-agnostic.\nIt's just an observation about the numerical relationships between variables.\nWhen we control for the future, we run the risk of introducing bias.\nIt's challenging to develop an intuition for this.\nConsider a case where `x` and `y` are the only causes of `q`, and all three variables are binary.\nWhen *either* `x` or `y` equals 1, then `q` happens.\nIf we know `q = 1` and `x = 0` then logically it must be that `y = 1`.\nThus, knowing about `q` gives us information about `y` via `x`.\nThis is an extreme example, but it shows how this type of bias, sometimes called *collider-stratification bias* or *selection bias*, occurs: conditioning on `q` provides statistical information about `x` and `y` and distorts their relationship.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exchangability revisited\n\nWe commonly refer exchangability as the assumption of no confounding.\nActually, this isn't quite right.\nIt's the assumption of no *open, non-causal* paths.\nMany times, these are confounding pathways.\nHowever, paths can also be opened by conditioning on a collider.\nEven though these aren't confounders, it creates non-exchangability between the two groups: they are different in a way that matters to the exposure and outcome.\n\nOpen, non-causal paths are also called *backdoor paths*.\nWe'll use this terminology often because it captures the idea well: these are any open paths that are biasing the effect we're interested in estimating\n:::\n\nCorrectly identifying the causal structure between the exposure and outcome thus helps us 1) communicate the assumptions we're making about the relationships between variables and 2) identify sources of bias.\nImportantly, in doing 2), we are also often able to identify ways to prevent bias based on the assumptions in 1).\nIn the simple case of three DAGs in @fig-dag-path-types, we know whether or not to control for `q` depending on the nature of the causal structure.\nThe set or sets of variables we need to adjust for is called the *adjustment set*.\nDAGs can help us identify adjustment sets even in complex settings.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## What about interaction?\n\nDAGs don't make a statement about interaction or effect estimate modification even though they are an important part of inference.\nTechnically, interaction is a matter of the functional form of the relationships in the DAG.\nMuch as we don't need to specify how we're going to model a variable in the DAG (e.g., with splines), we don't need to specify how variables statistically interact with one another.\nThat's a matter for the modeling stage.\n\nThere are several ways we use interactions in causal inference.\nIn one extreme, they are simply a matter of functional form: interaction terms are included in models but marginalized over to get an overall causal effect.\nIn the other extreme, we're interested in *joint causal effects*, where the two variables interacting with each other are both causal.\nIn between, we can use interaction terms to identify *heterogenous causal effects*, effects which vary by a second variable that is not assumed to be causal.\nAs with many tools in causal inference, we use the same statistical technique many ways to answer different questions.\n\n<!-- TODO: expand on this later in the book and link to chapter where we'll discuss -->\n\nMany people have tried ways of expressing interaction in DAGs using different types of arcs, nodes, and other annotations, but no approach has taken off as the preferred way.\n:::\n\nLet's take a look at an example in R.\nWe'll learn how to build DAGs, visualize them, and identify important information like adjustment sets.\n\n## DAGs in R\n\nFirst, let's consider the a research question: Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate students test scores?\nWe can diagram this using the method describe in @sec-diag (@fig-diagram-podcast).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate student test scores?](../images/podcast-diagram.png){#fig-diagram-podcast width=2267}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe main tool we'll use for making DAGs is ggdag.\nggdag is a package that connects ggplot2, the most powerful visualization tool in R, to dagitty, an R package with sophisticated algorithms for querying DAGs.\n\nTo create a DAG object, we'll use the `dagify()` function.`dagify()` returns a `dagitty` object that works with both the dagitty and ggdag packages.\nThe `dagify()` function takes formulas, separated by commas, that specify causes and effects, with the left element of of the formula specifying the effect and the right all of the factors that cause it.\nThis is just like the type of formula we specify for most regression models in R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  effect1 ~ cause1 + cause2 + cause3,\n  effect2 ~ cause1 + cause4,\n  ...\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat are all of the factors that cause graduate students to listen to a podcast the morning before an exam?\nWhat are all of the factors that could cause a graduate student to do well on a test?\nLet's posit some here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggdag)\ndagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared\n)\n```\n\n:::

a podcast the morning of the test\n-   their mood and how prepared they are also influences their exam score\n\nNotice we *do not* see podcast in the exam equation; this means that we assume that there is **no** causal relationship between podcast and the exam score.\n\nThere are some other useful arguments you'll often find yourself supplying to `dagify()`:\n\n-   `exposure` and `outcome`: Telling ggdag the variables that are the exposure and outcome of your research question is required for many of the most useful queries we can make of DAGs.\n-   `latent`: This argument lets us tell ggdag that some variables in the DAG are unmeasured. This is really useful for identifying valid adjustment sets with the data we actually have.\n-   `coords`: Coordinates for the variables. You can choose between algorithmic or manual layouts, as discussed in below. We'll use `time_ordered_coords()` here.\n-   `labels`: A character vector of labels for the variables.\n\nLet's create a DAG object, `podcast_dag`, that has some of these attributes, then visualize the DAG with `ggdag()`.\n`ggdag()` returns a ggplot object, so we can add additional layers to the plot like themes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(\n    list(\n      # time point 1\n      c(\"prepared\", \"humor\", \"mood\"), \n      # time point 2\n      \"podcast\",  \n      # time point 3\n      \"exam\"\n    )\n  ),\n  exposure = \"podcast\",\n  outcome = \"exam\",\n  labels = c(\n    podcast = \"podcast\",\n    exam = \"exam score\",\n    mood = \"mood\",\n    humor = \"humor\",\n    prepared = \"prepared\"\n  )\n)\nggdag(podcast_dag, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE) +\n  theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proposed DAG to answer the question: Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate students test scores?](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-dag-podcast-1.png){#fig-dag-podcast width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nFor the rest of the chapter, we'll use `theme_dag()`, a ggplot theme from ggdag meant for DAGs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(\n  theme_dag() %+replace%\n    theme(\n      legend.position = \"bottom\",\n      strip.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(2, 0, 2, 0, \"mm\"))\n    )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## DAG coordinates\n\nYou don't need to specify coordinates to ggdag.\nIf you don't, it uses algorithms designed for automatic layouts.\nThere are many such algorithms, and they focus on different aspects of the layout, e.g. the shape, the space between the nodes, minimizing how many edges cross, etc.\nThese layout algorithms usually have a component of randomness, so it's good to use a seed if you want to get the same result.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# no coordinates specified\nset.seed(123)\npod_dag <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared\n)\n\n# automatically determine layouts\npod_dag |> \n  ggdag(text_size = 2.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also ask for a specific layout, e.g. the popular Sugiyama algorithm for DAGs\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npod_dag |> \n  ggdag(layout = \"sugiyama\", text_size = 2.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor causal DAGs, the time-ordered layout algorithm is often best, which we can specify with `time_ordered_coords()` or `layout = \"time_ordered\"`.\nWe'll discuss time ordering in greater detail in @sec-time-ordered.\nEarlier, we explicitly told ggdag which variables were at which time points, but we don't need to.\nNotice, though, that the time ordering algorithm puts `podcast` and `exam` at the same timepoint since one doesn't cause another (and thus predate it).\nWe know that's not the case: listening to the podcast happened before taking the exam.\n\n<!-- TODO: if implementing a better way to use this algorithm while specifying on or more time points then update this -->\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npod_dag |> \n  ggdag(layout = \"time_ordered\", text_size = 2.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also manually specify coordinates using a list or data frame and provide them to the `coords` argument of `dagify()`.\nAdditionally, because ggdag is based on dagitty, you can use `dagitty.net` to create and organize a DAG using a graphical interface, then export the result as dagitty code for ggdag to consume.\n\nAlgorithmic layouts are often nice for fast visualization of DAGs or particularly complex graphs.\nOnce you want to share your DAG, it's usually best to be a little more intentional about the layout, perhaps by specifying the coordinates manually.\n`time_ordered_coords()` is often the best of both worlds, and we'll use it for most DAGs in this book.\n:::\n\nWe've specified the DAG for this question and told ggdag what the exposure and outcome of interest are.\nAccording to the DAG, there is no direct causal relationship between listening to a podcast and exam scores.\nAre there any other open paths?\n`ggdag_paths()` takes a DAG and visualizes the open paths.\nIn @fig-paths-podcast, we see two open paths: `podcast <- mood -> exam\"` and `podcast <- prepared -> exam`.

Often, backdoor paths are more complex. Let's consider such a case by adding two new variables: `alertness` and `skills_course`. `alertness` represents the feeling of alertness from a good mood, thus the arrow going from `mood` to `alertness`. `skills_course` represents whether the student took a College Skills Course and learned time management techniques. Now, `skills_course` is what frees up the time to listen to a podcast as well as being prepared for the exam. `mood` and `prepared` are no longer direct confounders: they are two variables along a more complex backdoor path. Additionally, we've added an arrow going from `humor` to `mood`. Let's take a look.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag2 <- dagify(\n    podcast ~ mood + humor + skills_course,\n    alertness ~ mood,\n    mood ~ humor,\n    prepared ~ skills_course,\n    exam ~ alertness + prepared,\n    coords = time_ordered_coords(),\n    exposure = \"podcast\",\n    outcome = \"exam\",\n    labels = c(\n        podcast = \"podcast\",\n        exam = \"exam score\",\n        mood = \"mood\",\n        alertness = \"alertness\",\n        skills_course = \"college\\nskills course\",\n        humor = \"humor\",\n        prepared = \"prepared\"\n    )\n)\n\nggdag(podcast_dag2, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNow there are *three* backdoor paths we need to close: `podcast <- humor -> mood -> alertness -> exam`, `podcast <- mood -> alertness -> exam`, and`podcast <- skills_course -> prepared -> exam`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggdag_paths(podcast_dag2, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE, shadow = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are 4 to close all three paths (and 18 full adjustment sets!).

Notably, `prepared` and `alertness` could happen at the same time or even after `podcast`. `skills_course` and `mood` still happen before both `podcast` and `exam`, so the idea is still the same: the confounding pathway starts before the exposure and outcome. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggdag_adjustment_set(podcast_dag2, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDeciding between these adjustment sets is a matter of judgment: if all data are perfectly measured, the DAG is correct, and we've modeled them correctly, then it doesn't matter which we use. Each adjustment set will result in an unbiased estimate. All three of those assumptions are usually untrue to some degree. Let's consider the path via `skills_course` and `prepared`. It may be that we are better able to assess whether or not someone took the College Skills Course than how prepared for the exam they are. In that case, an adjustment set with `skills_course` is a better option. But perhaps we better understand the relationship between preparedness and exam results. If we have it measured, controlling for that might be better. We could get the best of both worlds by including both variables: between the better measurement of `skills_course` and the better modeling of `prepared`, we might have a better chance of minimizing confounding from this path. \n\n### Selection Bias and Mediation\n\nSelection bias is another name for the type of bias that is induced by adjusting for a collider. It's called \"selection bias\" because a common form of collider-induced bias is a variable that is inherently stratified upon by the design of the study. Let's consider a case based on the original `podcast_dag` but with one additional variable: whether or not the student showed up to the exam. Now there is an indirect effect of `podcast` on `exam`: listening to a podcast influences whether or not the students showed up for the exam. The true result of `exam` is missing for those who didn't show up; by studying the group of people who *did* show up, we are inherently stratifying on this variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag3 <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared + showed_up,\n  showed_up ~ podcast + mood + prepared,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(\n    list(\n      # time point 1\n      c(\"prepared\", \"humor\", \"mood\"), \n      # time point 2\n      \"podcast\",  \n      \"showed_up\",  \n      # time point 3\n      \"exam\"\n    )\n  ),\n  exposure = \"podcast\",\n  outcome = \"exam\",\n  labels = c(\n    podcast = \"podcast\",\n    exam = \"exam score\",\n    mood = \"mood\",\n    humor = \"humor\",\n    prepared = \"prepared\",\n    showed_up = \"showed up\"\n  )\n)\nggdag(podcast_dag3, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe problem is that `showed_up` is both a collider and a mediator: stratifying on it induces a relationship between many of the variables in the DAG but blocks the the indirect effect of `podcast` on `exam`.

What if we were wrong about mood, and the actual relationship was M-shaped? Let's say that, rather than causing `podcast` and `exam`, mood was itself caused by two mutual causes of `podcast` and `exam`, `u1` and `u2`.

If we had either `u1` or `u2` measured, we could adjust for them to close this path, but we don't.

Sometimes, though, that is not an option. Imagine if, instead of `mood`, this turned out to be the real structure for `showed_up`: since we are inherently controlling for `showed_up`, and we don't have the unmeasured variables, our study results will always be biased. It's important to understand if we're in that situation so we can address it with sensitivity analysis to understand just how biased the effect would be.\n\nLet's consider a variation on M-bias where `mood` causes `podcast` and `exam` and `u1` and `u2` are mutual causes of `mood` and the exposure and outcome. This is sometimes called butterfly or bowtie bias, again because of its shape.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbutterfly_bias(x = \"podcast\", y = \"exam\", m = \"mood\", a = \"u1\", b = \"u2\") |> \n  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we're in a tough position: we need to control for `mood` because it's a confounder, but controlling for `mood` opens up the pathway from `u1` to `u2`. Because we don't have either variable measured, we can't then close the path opened from conditioning on `mood`. What should we do? It turns out that, when in doubt, controlling for `mood` is the better of the two options: confounding bias tends to be worse than collider bias, and M-shaped structures of colliders are very sensitive (e.g., a slight deviation from the M structure reduces the bias overall). \n\nAnother common form of selection bias is from *loss to follow-up*: people drop out of a study in a way that is related to the exposure and outcome. We'll come back to this topic in @sec-TODO.\n\n### Causes of the exposure, causes of the outcome\n\nLet's consider one other type of causal structure that's important: causes of the exposure and not the outcome, and their opposites, causes of the outcome and not the exposure. Let's add a variable, `grader_mood`, to the original DAG.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag5 <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared + grader_mood,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(\n    list(\n      # time point 1\n      c(\"prepared\", \"humor\", \"mood\"), \n      # time point 2\n      c(\"podcast\", \"grader_mood\"),  \n      # time point 3\n      \"exam\"\n    )\n  ),\n  exposure = \"podcast\",\n  outcome = \"exam\",\n  labels = c(\n    podcast = \"podcast\",\n    exam = \"exam score\",\n    mood = \"student\\nmood\",\n    humor = \"humor\",\n    prepared = \"prepared\",\n    grader_mood = \"grader\\nmood\"\n  )\n)\nggdag(podcast_dag5, use_labels = \"label\", text = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are now two variables that aren't related to *both* the exposure and the outcome: `humor`, which causes `podcast` but not `exam`, and `grader_mood`, which causes `exam` but not `podcast`. Let's start with `humor`.\n\nVariables that cause the exposure but not the outcome are also called *instrumental variables* (IVs). IVs are an unusual circumstance where, under certain conditions, controlling for them can make other types of bias worse. What's unusual about this is that IVs can *also* be used to conduct an entirely different approach to estimating an unbiased effect of the exposure on the outcome. IVs are commonly used this way in econometrics and are increasingly popular in other areas. In short, IV analysis allows us to estimate the causal effect using a different set of assumptions than the approaches we've talked about thus far. Sometimes, a problem that is intractible using propensity score methods is possible to address using IVs and vice versa. We'll talk more about IVs in @sec-TODO.\n\nSo, if you're *not* using IV methods, should you include an IV in a model meant to address confounding? If you're not sure if the variable is an IV or not, you should probably add it to your model: it's more likely to be a confounder than an IV, and, it turns out, the bias from adding an IV is usually small in practice. So, like adjusting for a potential M-structure variable, the risk of bias is worse from confounding.\n\nNow let's talk about the opposite of an IV: a cause of the outcome that is not the cause of the exposure. These variables are sometimes called *competing exposures* (because they also cause the outcome) or *precision variables* (because, as we'll see, the increase the precision of causal estimates). We'll call them precision variables because we're concerned about the relationship to the research question at hand, not to another research question where they are exposures.\n\nLike IVs, precision variables do not occur along paths from the exposure to the outcome. Thus, including them is not necessary. Unlike IVs, including precision variables is beneficial. Including other causes of the outcomes helps a statistical model capture some of its variation. This doesn't impact the point estimate of the effect, but it does reduce the variance, resulting in smaller standard errors and narrower confidence intervals. Thus, we recommend including them when possible.\n\nSo, even though we don't need to control for `grader_mood`, if we have it in the data set, we should. Similarly, `humor` is not a good addition to the model unless we think it really might be a confounder; if it is a true instrument, we might want to consider using IV methods to estimate the effect, instead.\n\n### Measurement Error and Missingness\n\nDAGs can also help us understand the bias that can arise from mismeasurements in the data, including the worse mismeasurement: not measuring it at all. We'll cover these topics in [Chapter -@sec-TODO-missingness], but the basic idea is that by separating the true value from the observed value, we can better understand how such biases may behave. Here's a basic example of a type of bias called *recall bias*. Recall bias is when the outcome influences a participant's memory of exposure, so it's a particular problem in retrospective studies where the earlier exposure is not recorded until after the outcome happens. An example of when this can occur is a case-control study of cancer. Someone *with* cancer may be more motivated to ruminate on their past exposures than someone *without* cancer. So, their memory about a given exposure may be more refined than someone without. By conditioning on the observed version of the exposure, we open up a many collider paths. Unfortunately, there is no way to close them all. If this is the case, then we need to ask how severe the bias would be in practice.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nerror_dag <- dagify(\n  exposure_observed ~ exposure_real + exposure_error,\n  outcome_observed ~ outcome_real + outcome_error,\n  outcome_real ~ exposure_real,\n  exposure_error ~ outcome_real,\n  labels = c(\n    exposure_real = \"Exposure\\n(truth)\",\n    exposure_error = \"Measurement Error\\n(exposure)\",\n    exposure_observed = \"Exposure\\n(observed)\",\n    outcome_real = \"Outcome\\n(truth)\",\n    outcome_error = \"Measurement Error\\n(outcome)\",\n    outcome_observed = \"Outcome\\n(observed)\"\n  ),\n  exposure = \"exposure_real\",\n  outcome = \"outcome_real\",\n  coords = time_ordered_coords()\n)\n\nerror_dag |> \n  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Recommendations in building DAGs\n\nIn principle, using DAGs is easy: you specify the causal relationships you think exist and then query the DAG for information like valid adjustment sets. In practice, assembling DAGs takes considerable time and thought. In fact, next to defining the research question itself, it's one of the hardest steps in making causal inferences. Very little guidance exists on best practices in assembling DAGs. @Tennant2021 collected data on DAGs in applied health research to better understand how they were being used. @tbl-dag-properties shows some information they collected: the median number of nodes and arcs in a DAG, their ration, the saturation percent of the DAG, and how many were fully saturated. Saturating DAGs means adding all possible arrows going forward in time, e.g. in a fully saturated DAG, any given variable at time point 1 has arrows going to all variables in future time points, and so on. Most DAGs were only about half saturated and very few were fully saturated. \n\nOnly about half of the papers using DAGs reported the adjustment set used. In other words, researchers presented their assumptions about the research question but not the implications about how they should handle the modeling stage or if in fact they did use a valid adjustment set. Similarly, the majority of studies did not report the estimand of interest.\n\n::: {.callout-note} \nThe estimand is the target of interest in terms of what it is we're trying to estimate, as discussed briefly in [Chapter -@sec-whole-game]. We'll discuss estimands in detail in [Chapter -@sec-estimands].\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dag-properties .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"kwsxntypwf\"

things you can do for the quality of your results is to make the DAG before you conduct the study, ideally before you even collect the data. If you're already working with your data, at minimum build your DAG prior to doing data analysis. This advice is similar in spirit to pre-registered analysis plans: declaring your assumptions ahead of time can help clarify what you need to do, reduce risk of overfitting (e.g., determining confounders incorrectly from the data), and give you time to get feedback on your DAG.\n\nThis last benefit is particularly important: you should ideally democratize your DAG. Share it early and often with others who are experts on the data, domain, and models. It's natural to create a DAG, present it to your colleagues, and realize you have missed something important. Sometimes you won't agree on every detail of the structure. That's a good thing: you know now where there is uncertainty in your DAG. You can then examine the results from more than one plausible DAG or address the uncertainty with sensitivity analyses.\n\nIf you have more than one candidate DAG, it might be useful to check their adjustment sets. If two DAGs have overlapping adjustment sets, focus on those sets; then, you can move forward in a way that satisfies the plausible assumptions you have.  \n\n### Consider your question\n\nAs we saw in @fig-COLLIDER-MEDIATION-TODO, some questions can be difficult to answer with certain data, while others are more approachable. You should consider exactly what it is you want to estimate. This is an important topic and the subject of [Chapter -@sec-estimands].\n\nAnother important detail about how your DAG relates to your question is the population and time. Many causal structures are not static over time and space. Consider lung cancer: the distribution of causes of lung cancer was considerably different before the spread of smoking. In medieval Japan, prior to the spread of tobacco from the Americas centuries later, the causal structure for lung cancer would have been practically different to what it is in Japan today, both in terms of tobacco use and other factors (age of the population, etc.) \n\nThe same is true for confounders. Even if something *can* cause the exposure and outcome, if the prevalence of that thing is zero in the population you're analyzing, it's irrelevant to the causal question. It may also be that, in some populations, it doesn't affect one of the two. The reverse is, of course, also true: there might be something unique to the target population. The use of tobacco in North America several centuries ago was unique among the world population, even though ceremonial tobacco use was quite different from modern recreational use. Many changes won't happen as dramatically as across centuries, but sometimes, they do, e.g. if regulation in one country effectively eliminates the population exposure to something.\n\n### Order nodes by time {#chapter-05-sec-time-ordered}\n\nAs we discussed earlier, we recommend ordering your variables by time, either left-to-right or up-to-down. There are two reasons for this. First, time ordering is an important part of your assumptions. After all, something happening before another thing is a requirement for it to be a cause. Thinking this through carefully will clarify your DAG and the variables you need to address. \n\nSecond, after a certain level of complexity, it's easier to read a DAG when it is arranged by time because you have to think less about that dimension; it's inherent to the layout. The time ordering algorithm in ggdag automates much of this for you, although as we saw earlier, it's sometimes helpful to give it more information about the order.\n\nA related topic is feedback loops. Often we think about two things that mutually cause each other as happening in a circle, like global warming and A/C use (A/C use increases global warming, which makes it hotter, which increases A/C use, and so on). It's tempting to visualize that relationship like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  ac_use ~ global_temp,\n  global_temp ~ ac_use,\n  labels = c(ac_use = \"A/C use\", global_temp = \"Global\\ntemperature\")\n) |> \n  ggdag(layout = \"circle\", edge_type = \"arc\", text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png){width=336}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom a DAG perspective, this is a problem because of the *A* part of *DAG*: it's cyclic! Importantly, though, it's also not correct from a causal perspective. Feedback loops are a shorthand for what really happens, which is that the two variables mutually affect each other *over time*. Causality only goes forward in time, so it doesn't make since for it to go back and forth like in @fig-TODO.\n\nThe real DAG looks something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  global_temp_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,\n  ac_use_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,\n  global_temp_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,\n  ac_use_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,\n  global_temp_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,\n  ac_use_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(),\n  labels = c(\n    ac_use_1990 = \"A/C use\\n(1990)\", \n    global_temp_1990 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(1990)\",\n    ac_use_2000 = \"A/C use\\n(2000)\", \n    global_temp_2000 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2000)\",\n    ac_use_2010 = \"A/C use\\n(2010)\", \n    global_temp_2010 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2010)\",\n    ac_use_2020 = \"A/C use\\n(2020)\", \n    global_temp_2020 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2020)\"\n  )\n) |> \n  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe two variables, rather than being in a feed*back* loop are actually in a feed*forward* loop: they co-evolve over time. Here, we only show four discrete moments in time (the decades from 1990 to 2020), but of course we could get much finer depending on the question and data. \n\nAs with any DAG, the right analysis approach depends on the question. The effect of A/C use in 2000 on global temperature in 2020 produces a different adjustment set than the global temperature in 2000 on A/C use in 2020. Similarly, whether we also model this change over time or just those two time points depends on the question. Often, these types of feedforward relationships require you to address *time-varying* confounding, which we'll discuss in @sec-TODO.\n\n### Consider the whole data collection process\n\nAs @fig-TODO showed us, it's important to consider the *way* we collected data as much as the causal structure of the question at hand. This is particularly true if you're working with \"found\" data---a data set not intentionally collected to answer the research question. We are always inherently conditioning on the data we have vs. the data we don't have. If the data collection process was influenced by other variables in the causal structure, you need to consider what the effect is. Do you need to control for additional variables? Do you need to change the effect you are trying to estimate? Can you answer the question at all?\n\n<!-- TODO: revisit this after I've thought it through a bit more -->\n<!-- Let's consider an example: workers at a factory are potentially exposed to something (e.g., a carcinogenic) that may increase their risk of dying. Some workers are exposed, and some are not. The problem is that exposure *prior* to the study resulted in only those healthy enough to work being present at the start of the study. If there is another factor, say some important aspect of the worker's health, that also contributes to whether or not they are at work, we have selection bias.

Case-control studies are particularly useful when the outcome under study is rare or take a very long time to happen (like many types of cancer). Participants are selected into the study based on their outcome: once a person has an event, the are entered as a case and matched with a control who hasn't had the event. Often, they are matched on other factors as well.\n\nMatched case-control studies are selection biased by design. In @fig-TODO, when we condition on selection into the study, we lose the ability to close all backdoor paths, even if we control for `confounder`. From the DAG, it would appear that the entire design is invalid!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  outcome ~ confounder + exposure,\n  selection ~ outcome + confounder,\n  exposure ~ confounder,\n  exposure = \"exposure\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\",\n  coords = time_ordered_coords()\n) |> \n  ggdag(edge_type = \"arc\", text_size = 2.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLuckily, this isn't completely true. Case-control studies are limited in the type of causal effects they can estimate (causal odds ratios, which under some circumstances approximate causal risk ratios). With careful study design and sampling, the math works out such that these estimates are still valid. Exactly how and why case-control studies work are beyond the scope of this book, but they are a remarkably clever design. \n:::\n\n### Include variables you don't have\n\nIt's critical that you include *all* variables important to the causal structure, not just they variables you have measured in your data. ggdag can mark variables as unmeasured (\"latent\"); it will then return only useable adjustment sets, e.g., those without the unmeasured variables. Of course, the best thing to do is to use DAGs to help you understand what to measure in the first place, but there are many reasons why that might not be the case for your data. Even data that was intentionally collected for the research question might not have a variable that was discovered to be a confounder after data collection.\n\nFor instance, if we have a DAG where `exposure` and `outcome` have a confounding pathway consisting of `confounder1` and `confounder2`, we can control for either to succesfully debias the estimate:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,\n  exposure ~ confounder2,\n  confounder2 ~ confounder1,\n  exposure = \"exposure\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\"\n) |> \n  adjustmentSets()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ confounder1 }\n{ confounder2 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThus, if just one is missing (`latent`), then we are ok:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,\n  exposure ~ confounder2,\n  confounder2 ~ confounder1,\n  exposure = \"exposure\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\",\n  latent = \"confounder1\"\n) |> \n  adjustmentSets()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ confounder2 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut if both are missing, there are no valid adjustment sets.\n\nWhen you don't have a variable measured, you still have a few options. As mentioned above, you may be able to identify alternate adjustment sets. If the missing variable is required to completely close all backdoor paths, you can and should conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of not having it. This is the subject of [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity]. \n\nUnder some lucky circumstances, you can also use a *proxy* confounder. A proxy confounder is a variable that is closely related to the confounder such that controlling for it controls for some of the effect of the missing variable. Consider an expansion of the basic confounding relationship where `q` has a cause, `p`. Technically, if we don't have `q`, we can't close the backdoor path and our effect will be biased. Practically, though, if `p` is highly correlated with `q`, it can serve as a method to reduce the confounding from `q`. You can think of `p` as a mismeasured version of `q`; it will almost never completely control for the biased via `q`, but it can help minimize it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  y ~ x + q,\n  x ~ q,\n  q ~ p,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords()\n) |> \n  ggdag(edge_type = \"arc\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Saturate your DAG then prune\n\nIn discussing @tbl-TODO, we mentioned *saturated* DAGs. These are DAGs where all possible arrows are included based on the time-ordering, e.g. every variable causes variables that come after it in time.\n\n*Not* including an arrow is a bigger assumption than including one. In other words, your default should be to include an arrow from one variable to a future variable. This is counter intuitive to many people. How can it be that we need to be so careful about assessing causal effects yet be so liberal in applying causal assumptions in the DAG? The answer to this lies in the strength and prevalence of the cause. Technically, an arrow present means that *for at least a single observation*, the prior node causes the following node. The arrow similarly says nothing about the strength of the relationship. So, a minuscule causal effect on a single individual justifies the presence of an arrow. Of course, in practice, such a case is probably not relevant. There is *effectively* no arrow. \n\nThe larger point, though, is that you should not feel hesitant to add an arrow. The bar for justification is much lower than you might think. Instead, it's helpful to 1) determine your time ordering 2) saturate the DAG then 3) prune out implausible arrows.\n\nLet's experiment by working through a saturated version of the podcast-exam DAG. \n\nFirst, the time-ordering. Presumably, the student's sense of humor far predates the day of the exam. Mood in the morning, too, predates listening to the podcast or exam score, as does preparation. The saturated DAG given this ordering is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag_sat <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared + humor,\n  prepared ~ humor,\n  mood ~ humor,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(\n    list(\n      \"humor\",\n      c(\"prepared\", \"mood\"), \n      \"podcast\",  \n      \"exam\"\n    )\n  ),\n  exposure = \"podcast\",\n  outcome = \"exam\",\n  labels = c(\n    podcast = \"podcast\",\n    exam = \"exam score\",\n    mood = \"mood\",\n    humor = \"humor\",\n    prepared = \"prepared\"\n  )\n)\n\n# TODO echo: false this and customize the arc for humor to exam\nggdag(podcast_dag_sat, text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThere are a few new arrows here. Humor now causes the other two confounders, as well as exam score. Some of them make sense. Sense of humor probably affects mood for some people. What about preparedness? This seems a little less plausible. Similarly, we know sense of humor is not affecting exam score because the grading is blinded. Let's prune those two.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npodcast_dag_pruned <- dagify(\n  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,\n  exam ~ mood + prepared,\n  mood ~ humor,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(\n    list(\n      \"humor\",\n      c(\"prepared\", \"mood\"), \n      \"podcast\",  \n      \"exam\"\n    )\n  ),\n  exposure = \"podcast\",\n  outcome = \"exam\",\n  labels = c(\n    podcast = \"podcast\",\n    exam = \"exam score\",\n    mood = \"mood\",\n    humor = \"humor\",\n    prepared = \"prepared\"\n  )\n)\n\n# TODO echo: false this and customize the arc for humor to exam\nggdag(podcast_dag_pruned, text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chapter-05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems a little more reasonable. So, was our original DAG wrong? That depends on a number of factors. Importantly, both DAGs produce the same adjustment set: controlling for `mood` and `prepared` will give us an unbiased effect if either DAG is correct. Even if the new DAG were to produce a different adjustment set, whether it the result is meaningfully different depends on the strength of the confounding. \n\n### Include instruments and precision variables\n\nTechnically, you do not need to include instrumental and precision variables in your DAG. The adjustment sets will be the same with and without them. However, adding them is important for two reasons. Firstly, they demonstrate your assumptions about the relationships between them and the variables under study. As we discussed above, *not* including an arrow is a bigger assumption than including one, so it's useful information about how you think the causal structure operates. Secondly, it impacts your modeling decision. You should always include precision variables in your model to reduce variability in your estimate, so it helps you identify those. Instruments are also useful to see because they may guide alternative or complementary modeling strategies, as we'll discuss in @sec-TODO-triangulation.  \n\n### Focus on the causal structure, then consider measurement bias\n\nAs we saw above, missingness and measurement error can be a source of bias. As we'll see in [Chapter -@sec-TODO-missingness], we have a number of strategies to approach such a situation. Yet, most everything we measure is inaccurate to some degree. The true DAG for the data at hand inherently conditions on the measured version of variables. In that since, your data are always subtly wrong, a sort of unreliable narrator. So, when should we include this information in the DAG? We recommend first focusing on the causal structure of the DAG as if you had perfectly measured each variable. Then, think through how mismeasurement and missingness might affect the realized data, particularly as they relate to the exposure, outcome, and key confounders. You may prefer to present this as an alternative DAG to consider strategies for addressing the bias arising from those sources, e.g. imputation or sensitivity analyses. After all, the DAG in @fig-dag-measurement-error-TODO would have you think the question is unanswerable because we have no method to close all backdoor paths. As with all open paths, that depends on the severity of the bias and our ability to reckon with it.\n\n<!-- TODO: I don't quite remember what I wanted to cover here, so revisit later to add or delete -->\n<!-- ### Be accurate, but focus on clarity -->\n\n### Pick adjustment sets most likely to be succesful\n\nOne area where measurement error is an important consideration is when picking an adjustment set. In theory, if a DAG is correct, any adjustment set will work to create an unbiased result. In practice, variables have different levels of quality. Pick an adjustment set that is most likely to succeed because contains accurate variables. Similarly, non-minimal adjustment sets are helpful to consider because together, several variables with measurement error along a backdoor path may together be enough to minimize the practical bias resulting from that path.\n\nWhat if you don't have certain key variables measured and thus do not have a valid adjustment set? In that case, you should pick the adjustment set with the best chance of minimizing the bias from other backdoor paths. All is not lost if you don't have every confounder measured: get the highest quality estimate you can, then conduct a sensitivity analysis about the unmeasured variables to understand the impact.\n\n### Use robustness checks\n\nFinally, we recommend checking your DAG for robustness. You can never truly verify the correctness of your DAG under most conditions, but you can use the implications in your DAG to support it. There are three types of robustness checks that can be useful depending on the circumstances. \n\n1. **Negative controls**. These come in two flavors: negative exposure controls and negative outcome controls. The idea is to find something associated with one but not the other, e.g. the outcome but not the exposure, such that there should be no effect. Since there should be no effect, you now have a measurement for how well you are controlling for *other* effects (e.g., the difference from null). Ideally, the set of confounders for negative controls are similar to the research question's.\n2. DAG-data consistency. Negative controls are an implication of your DAG. An extension of this idea is that there are *many* such implications. Because blocking a path removes statistical dependencies from that path, you can check those assumptions in several places in your DAG.\n3. Alternate adjustment sets. All things being equal, adjustment sets should give roughly the same answer because, outside of random and measurement error, they are all sets that block backdoor paths. If more than one adjustment set seems reasonable, you can use that as a sensitivity analysis by checking more than one model.\n\nWe'll discuss each of these in detail in [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity]. The caveat here is that these should be complementary to your initial DAG not a way of *replacing* it. In fact, if you use more than one adjustment set during the course of your analysis, you should report the results from all of them to avoid overfitting your results to your data.\n\n\n",
