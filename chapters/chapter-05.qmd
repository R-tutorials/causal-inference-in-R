## Visualizing Causal Assumptions

> Draw your assumptions before your conclusions --@hernan2021

Causal diagrams are a tool to visualize your assumptions about the causal structure of the questions you're trying to answer.
In a randomized experiment, the causal structure is quite simple: while there may be many causes of an outcome, the only cause of the exposure is the randomization process itself (we hope!).
In many non-randomized settings, however, the structure of your question can be a complex web of causality.
Causal diagrams help communicate what we think this structure looks like.
In addition to being open about what we think the causal structure is, causal diagrams have incredible mathematics properties that allow us to identify a way to estimate unbiased causal effects even with observational data.

Causal diagrams are also increasingly common.
Data collected as a review of the use of causal diagrams in applied health research papers show a drastic increase in use over time [@Tennant2021].

  )
```

The type of causal diagrams we use are also called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
These graphs are directed because they include arrows going in a specific direction.
They're acyclic because they don't go in circles; a variable can't cause itself, for instance.
DAGs are used for a wide variety of problems, but we're specificaly concerned with *causal* DAGs.
This class of DAGs is also sometimes referred to as Structural Causal Models (SCMs) because they are a model of the causal structure of a question.

## DAGs down under

We highly recommend asking an Australian friend about DAGs.
:::

DAGs depict causal relationships between variables.
Visually, the way they depict variables is as *edges* and *nodes*.
Edges are the arrows going from one variable to another, also sometimes called arcs or just arrows.
Nodes are the variables themselves, sometimes called vertices, points, or just variables.
in @fig-dag-basic, there are two nodes: `x` and `y` and one edge going from `x` to `y`.
Here, we are saying that `x` causes `y`.
In some capacity, `y` "listens" to `x`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: fig-dag-basic
#| fig-width: 3
#| fig-height: 2
# TODO: add caption
library(ggdag)
dagify(y ~ x, coords = time_ordered_coords()) |> 
  ggdag() + 
  theme_dag() + 
  expand_plot(expand_x = expansion(c(.2, .2)))
```

If we're interested in the causal effect of `x` on `y`, we're trying to estimate a numeric representation of that arrow.
Usually, though, there are many other variables and arrows in the causal structure of a given question.
A series of arrows is called a *path*.
There are three types of paths you'll see in DAGs: forks, chains, and colliders (sometimes called inverse forks).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-dag-path-types
# TODO: add caption
coords <- list(x = c(x = 0, y = 2, q = 1), y = c(x = 0, y = 0, q = 1))

fork <- dagify(
  x ~ q,
  y ~ q,
  exposure = "x",
  outcome = "y",
  coords = coords
)

chain <- dagify(
  q ~ x,
  y ~ q,
  exposure = "x",
  outcome = "y",
  coords = coords
)

collider <- dagify(
  q ~ x + y,
  exposure = "x",
  outcome = "y",
  coords = coords
)

dag_flows <- map(list(fork = fork, chain = chain, collider = collider), tidy_dagitty) |> 
  map("data") |> 
  list_rbind(names_to = "dag") |> 
  mutate(dag = factor(dag, levels = c("fork", "chain", "collider")))

dag_flows |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_edges(edge_width = 1) + 
  geom_dag_point() + 
  geom_dag_text() + 
  facet_wrap(~ dag) +
  expand_plot(
    expand_x = expansion(c(0.2, 0.2)),
    expand_y = expansion(c(0.2, 0.2))
  ) +
  theme_dag()
```

Forks represent a common cause of two variables.
Here, we're saying that `q` causes both `x` and `y`.
This is the traditional definition of a confounder.
They're called forks because the arrows from `x` to `y` are in different directions.
Chains, on the other hand, represent a series of arrows going in the same direction.
Here `q` is called a *mediator*: it is along the causal path from `x` to `y`.
In this diagram, the only path from `x` to `y` is the one mediated through `q`.
Finally, a collider is a path where two arrowheads meet at a variable.
Because causality always goes forward in time, this naturally means that the collider variable is caused by two other variables.
Here, we're saying that `x` and `y` both cause `q`.

::: callout-tip
## Are DAGs SEMs?

If you're familiar with structural equation models (SEMs), a modeling technique commonly used in psychology and other social science settings, you may notice some similarities between SEMs and DAGs.
In fact, DAGs are a form of *non-parametric* SEM.
SEMs estimate entire graphs using parametric assumptions.
Causal DAGs, on the other hand, don't estimate anything; an arrow going from one variable to another says nothing about the strength or functional form of that relationship, only that we think it exists.
:::

One of the major benefits of DAGs is that they help us identify sources of bias and, often, provide clues in how to address them.
However, talking about an unbiased effect estimate only makes sense when we have a specific causal question in mind.
Since each arrow represents a cause, it's causality all the way down, so no individual arrow is inherently problematic.
Here, we're interested in the effect of `x` on `y`.
This question defines which paths we're interested in and which we're not.

These three types of paths have different implications for the statistical relationship between `x` and `y`.
If we only look at the correlation between the two variables under these assumptions:

1.  In the fork, `x` and `y` will be associated, despite there being no arrow from `x` to `y`.
2.  In the chain, `x` and `y` are related but only through `q`.
3.  In the collider, `x` and `y` will *not* be related.

Paths that transmit association are called *open paths*.
Paths that do not transmit association are called *closed paths*.
Forks and chains are open while colliders are closed.

So, should we adjust for `q`?
That depends on the nature of the path.
Forks are confounding paths.
Because `q` causes both `x` and `y`, `x` and `y` will have a spurious association.
They both contain information from `q`, their mutual cause, and that mutual causal relationship makes `x` and `y` associated statistically.
Adjusting for `q` will *block* the bias from confounding and give us the true relationship between `x` and `y`.

::: callout-tip
## Adjustment

We can use a variety of techniques to account for a variable.
We use the term "adjustment" to generally refer to any technique that removes the effect of variables we're not interested in.
:::

@fig-confounder-scatter depicts this effect visually.
Here, `x` and `y` are continuous, and by definition of the DAG, they are unrelated.
`q`, however, causes both.
The unadjusted effect is biased because it includes information about the open path from `x` to `y` via `z`.
Within levels of `z`, however, `x` and `y` are unrelated.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-confounder-scatter
#| message: false
set.seed(123)
library(patchwork)
n <- 1000

### q
q <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = .35)
###

### x
x <- 2 * q + rnorm(n)
###

### y
y <- -3 * q + rnorm(n)
###

confounder_data <- tibble(x, y, q = as.factor(q))

p1 <- confounder_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ "not adjusting for `q`\n(biased)")

p2 <- confounder_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = q)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ "adjusting for `q`\n(unbiased)")

p1 + p2
```

For chains, whether or not we adjusting for mediators depends on the research question.
Here, adjusting for `q` would result in a null estimate of the effect of `x` on `y`.
Because the only effect of `x` on `y` is via `q`, no other effect remains.
The effect of `x` on `y` mediated by `q` is called the *indirect* effect, while the effect of `x` on `y` directly is called the *direct* effect.
If we're only interested in the direct effect, controlling for `q` might be what we want.
If we want to know about both effects, we shouldn't try to adjust for `q`.
We'll learn more estimating different mediation effects in @sec-mediation.

@fig-mediator-scatter shows this effect visually.
The unadjusted effect of `x` on `y` represents the total effect.
Since the total effect is due entirely to the path mediated by `q`, when we adjust for `q`, no relationship remains.
This is the direct effect.
Neither of these effects is due to bias but rather each answers a different research question.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-mediator-scatter
#| message: false
### x
x <- rnorm(n)
###

### q
linear_pred <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
prob <- 1 / (1 + exp(-linear_pred))
q <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = prob)
###

### y
y <- 2 * q + rnorm(n)
###

mediator_data <- tibble(x, y, q = as.factor(q))

p1 <- mediator_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ "not adjusting for `q`\n(total effect)")

p2 <- mediator_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = q)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ "adjusting for `q`\n(direct effect)")

p1 + p2
```

Colliders are different.
In the collider DAG of @fig-dag-path-types, `x` and `y` are *not* associated, but both cause `q`.
Adjusting for `q` has the opposite effect than with confounding: it *opens* a biasing pathway.
Sometimes, people draw the path opened up by conditioning on a collider connecting `x` and `y`.

Visually, we can see this happen when `x` and `y` are continuous and `q` is binary.
In @fig-collider-scatter, when we don't include `q`, we find there is no relationship between `x` and `y`.
That's the correct result.
However, when we include `q`, we can detect information about both `x` and `y`, and they appear correlated: across levels of `x`, those with `q = 0` have lower levels of `y`.
Association seemingly flows back in time.
Of course, that can't happen from a causal perspective, so controlling for `q` is the wrong thing to do.
We end up with a biased effect of `x` on `y`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-collider-scatter
#| message: false

### x
x <- rnorm(n)
###

### y
y <- rnorm(n)
###

### q
linear_pred <- 2*x + 3*y + rnorm(n)
prob <- 1 / (1 + exp(-linear_pred))
q <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = prob)
###

collider_data <- tibble(x, y, q = as.factor(q))

p1 <- collider_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~"not adjusting for `q`\n(unbiased)")

p2 <- collider_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = q)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~"adjusting for `q`\n(biased)")

p1 + p2
```

How can this be?
Since `x` and `y` happen before `q`, `q` can't have an impact on them.
Let's turn the DAG on its side and consider @fig-collider-time.
If we break down the two time points, at time point 1, `q` hasn't happened yet, and `x` and `y` are unrelated.
At time point 2, `q` happens due to `x` and `y`.
But causality only goes forward in time.
`q` happening later can't change the fact that `x` and `y` happened independently at time point 1.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-collider-time

coords <- list(x = c(x = 0, y = 2, q = 1), y = c(x = 0, y = 0, q = -1))
collider <- dagify(
    q ~ x + y,
    exposure = "x",
    outcome = "y",
    coords = time_ordered_coords()
)

collider_t <- collider |> 
  tidy_dagitty() |> 
  mutate(time = "time point 1", direction = NA, to = NA) |> 
  filter(name != "q")

t2 <- collider |> 
 tidy_dagitty() |> 
 mutate(time = "time point 2") |> 
  pull_dag_data()

collider_t$data <- bind_rows(collider_t$data, t2)

collider_t |> 
  mutate(deemphasize = (name %in% c("x", "y") & time == 
           "time point 2")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_edges(edge_width = 1, edge_color = "grey85") + 
  geom_dag_point(aes(color = deemphasize), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_dag_text() + 
  facet_wrap(~ time) + 
  theme_dag() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "grey85", "FALSE" = "black"))
```

Causality only goes forward.
Association, however, is time-agnostic.
It's just an observation about the numerical relationships between variables.
When we control for the future, we run the risk of introducing bias.
It's challenging to develop an intuition for this.
Consider a case where `x` and `y` are the only causes of `q`, and all three variables are binary.
When *either* `x` or `y` equals 1, then `q` happens.
If we know `q = 1` and `x = 0` then logically it must be that `y = 1`.
Thus, knowing about `q` gives us information about `y` via `x`.
This is an extreme example, but it shows how this type of bias, sometimes called *collider-stratification bias* or *selection bias*, occurs: conditioning on `q` provides statistical information about `x` and `y` and distorts their relationship.

## Exchangability revisited

We commonly refer exchangability as the assumption of no confounding.
Actually, this isn't quite right.
It's the assumption of no *open, non-causal* paths.
Many times, these are confounding pathways.
However, paths can also be opened by conditioning on a collider.
Even though these aren't confounders, it creates non-exchangability between the two groups: they are different in a way that matters to the exposure and outcome.

Open, non-causal paths are also called *backdoor paths*.
We'll use this terminology often because it captures the idea well: these are any open paths that are biasing the effect we're interested in estimating
:::

Correctly identifying the causal structure between the exposure and outcome thus helps us 1) communicate the assumptions we're making about the relationships between variables and 2) identify sources of bias.
Importantly, in doing 2), we are also often able to identify ways to prevent bias based on the assumptions in 1).
In the simple case of three DAGs in @fig-dag-path-types, we know whether or not to control for `q` depending on the nature of the causal structure.
The set or sets of variables we need to adjust for is called the *adjustment set*.
DAGs can help us identify adjustment sets even in complex settings.

::: callout-tip
## What about interaction?

DAGs don't make a statement about interaction or effect estimate modification even though they are an important part of inference.
Technically, interaction is a matter of the functional form of the relationships in the DAG.
Much as we don't need to specify how we're going to model a variable in the DAG (e.g., with splines), we don't need to specify how variables statistically interact with one another.
That's a matter for the modeling stage.

There are several ways we use interactions in causal inference.
In one extreme, they are simply a matter of functional form: interaction terms are included in models but marginalized over to get an overall causal effect.
In the other extreme, we're interested in *joint causal effects*, where the two variables interacting with each other are both causal.
In between, we can use interaction terms to identify *heterogenous causal effects*, effects which vary by a second variable that is not assumed to be causal.
As with many tools in causal inference, we use the same statistical technique many ways to answer different questions.

<!-- TODO: expand on this later in the book and link to chapter where we'll discuss -->

Many people have tried ways of expressing interaction in DAGs using different types of arcs, nodes, and other annotations, but no approach has taken off as the preferred way.
:::

Let's take a look at an example in R.
We'll learn how to build DAGs, visualize them, and identify important information like adjustment sets.

## DAGs in R

First, let's consider the a research question: Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate students test scores?
We can diagram this using the method describe in @sec-diag (@fig-diagram-podcast).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate student test scores?"
#| fig-height: 2
#| label: fig-diagram-podcast
knitr::include_graphics("../images/podcast-diagram.png")
```

The main tool we'll use for making DAGs is ggdag.
ggdag is a package that connects ggplot2, the most powerful visualization tool in R, to dagitty, an R package with sophisticated algorithms for querying DAGs.

To create a DAG object, we'll use the `dagify()` function.`dagify()` returns a `dagitty` object that works with both the dagitty and ggdag packages.
The `dagify()` function takes formulas, separated by commas, that specify causes and effects, with the left element of of the formula specifying the effect and the right all of the factors that cause it.
This is just like the type of formula we specify for most regression models in R.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dagify(
  effect1 ~ cause1 + cause2 + cause3,
  effect2 ~ cause1 + cause4,
  ...
)
```

What are all of the factors that cause graduate students to listen to a podcast the morning before an exam?
What are all of the factors that could cause a graduate student to do well on a test?
Let's posit some here.

```{r}
library(ggdag)
dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared
)
```

In the code above, we assume that:

-   a graduate student's mood, sense of humor, and how prepared they feel for the exam could influence whether they listened to a podcast the morning of the test
-   their mood and how prepared they are also influences their exam score

Notice we *do not* see podcast in the exam equation; this means that we assume that there is **no** causal relationship between podcast and the exam score.

There are some other useful arguments you'll often find yourself supplying to `dagify()`:

-   `exposure` and `outcome`: Telling ggdag the variables that are the exposure and outcome of your research question is required for many of the most useful queries we can make of DAGs.
-   `latent`: This argument lets us tell ggdag that some variables in the DAG are unmeasured. This is really useful for identifying valid adjustment sets with the data we actually have.
-   `coords`: Coordinates for the variables. You can choose between algorithmic or manual layouts, as discussed in below. We'll use `time_ordered_coords()` here.
-   `labels`: A character vector of labels for the variables.

Let's create a DAG object, `podcast_dag`, that has some of these attributes, then visualize the DAG with `ggdag()`.
`ggdag()` returns a ggplot object, so we can add additional layers to the plot like themes.

```{r}
#| label: fig-dag-podcast
#| fig-cap: "Proposed DAG to answer the question: Does listening to a comedy podcast the morning before an exam improve graduate students test scores?"
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
podcast_dag <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(
    list(
      # time point 1
      c("prepared", "humor", "mood"), 
      # time point 2
      "podcast",  
      # time point 3
      "exam"
    )
  ),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "mood",
    humor = "humor",
    prepared = "prepared"
  )
)
ggdag(podcast_dag, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE) +
  theme_dag()
```

::: callout-note
For the rest of the chapter, we'll use `theme_dag()`, a ggplot theme from ggdag meant for DAGs.

```{r}
theme_set(
  theme_dag() %+replace%
    theme(
      legend.position = "bottom",
      strip.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(2, 0, 2, 0, "mm"))
    )
)
```

## DAG coordinates

You don't need to specify coordinates to ggdag.
If you don't, it uses algorithms designed for automatic layouts.
There are many such algorithms, and they focus on different aspects of the layout, e.g. the shape, the space between the nodes, minimizing how many edges cross, etc.
These layout algorithms usually have a component of randomness, so it's good to use a seed if you want to get the same result.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
# no coordinates specified
set.seed(123)
pod_dag <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared
)

# automatically determine layouts
pod_dag |> 
  ggdag(text_size = 2.8)
```

We can also ask for a specific layout, e.g. the popular Sugiyama algorithm for DAGs

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
pod_dag |> 
  ggdag(layout = "sugiyama", text_size = 2.8)
```

For causal DAGs, the time-ordered layout algorithm is often best, which we can specify with `time_ordered_coords()` or `layout = "time_ordered"`.
We'll discuss time ordering in greater detail in @sec-time-ordered.
Earlier, we explicitly told ggdag which variables were at which time points, but we don't need to.
Notice, though, that the time ordering algorithm puts `podcast` and `exam` at the same timepoint since one doesn't cause another (and thus predate it).
We know that's not the case: listening to the podcast happened before taking the exam.

<!-- TODO: if implementing a better way to use this algorithm while specifying on or more time points then update this -->

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
pod_dag |> 
  ggdag(layout = "time_ordered", text_size = 2.8)
```

You can also manually specify coordinates using a list or data frame and provide them to the `coords` argument of `dagify()`.
Additionally, because ggdag is based on dagitty, you can use `dagitty.net` to create and organize a DAG using a graphical interface, then export the result as dagitty code for ggdag to consume.

Algorithmic layouts are often nice for fast visualization of DAGs or particularly complex graphs.
Once you want to share your DAG, it's usually best to be a little more intentional about the layout, perhaps by specifying the coordinates manually.
`time_ordered_coords()` is often the best of both worlds, and we'll use it for most DAGs in this book.
:::

We've specified the DAG for this question and told ggdag what the exposure and outcome of interest are.
According to the DAG, there is no direct causal relationship between listening to a podcast and exam scores.
Are there any other open paths?
`ggdag_paths()` takes a DAG and visualizes the open paths.
In @fig-paths-podcast, we see two open paths: `podcast <- mood -> exam"` and `podcast <- prepared -> exam`. These are both forks---*confounding pathways*. Since there is no causal relationship between listening to a podcast and exam scores, the only open paths are *backdoor* paths, these two confounding pathways.

```{r}
#| label: fig-paths-podcast
# TODO: Why aren't okabe-ito colors propgating here and other spots in ggdag?
podcast_dag |> 
  # show the whole dag as a light gray "shadow" 
  # rather than just the paths
  ggdag_paths(shadow = TRUE, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

::: callout-tip
`dagify()` returns a `dagitty()` object, but underneath the hood, ggdag converts `dagitty` objects to tidy DAGs, a structure that holds both the `dagitty` object and a `dataframe` about the DAG.
This is handy if you want to manipulate the DAG programatically.

```{r}
podcast_dag_tidy <- podcast_dag |> 
  tidy_dagitty()

podcast_dag_tidy
```

Most of the quick plotting functions transform the `dagitty` object to a tidy DAG if it's not already, then manipulate the data in some capacity.
For instance, `dag_paths()` underlies `ggdag_paths()`; it returns a tidy DAG with data about the paths.
You can use several dplyr functions on these objects directly.

```{r}
podcast_dag_tidy |> 
  dag_paths() |> 
  filter(set == 2, path == "open path")
```

Tidy DAGs are not pure data frames, but you can retrieve either the `dataframe` or `dagitty` object to work with them directly using `pull_dag_data()` or `pull_dag()`.
`pull_dag()` can be useful when you want to work with dagitty functions:

```{r}
library(dagitty)
podcast_dag_tidy |> 
  pull_dag() |> 
  paths()
```
:::

Backdoor paths pollute the statistical association between `podcast` and `exam`, so we need to account for them.
`ggdag_adjustment_set()` visualizes any valid adjustment sets implied by the DAG.
@fig-podcast-adustment-set shows variables that are adjusted for as squares.
Any arrows that were coming out of adjusted variables are removed from the DAG, because the path is longer open at that variable.

```{r}
#| label: fig-podcast-adustment-set
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
ggdag_adjustment_set(
  podcast_dag, 
  text = FALSE, 
  use_labels = "label"
)
```

@fig-podcast-adustment-set shows the *minimal adjustment set*.
By default, ggdag returns the set(s) that can close all backdoor paths with the fewest number of variables possible.
In this DAG, that's just one set: `mood` and `prepared`.
This makes sense, because there are two backdoor paths and the only other variables on them besides the exposure and outcome are these two variables.
So, at minimum, we need to account for both to get a valid estimate.

::: {.callout-tip}
`ggdag()` and friends usually use `tidy_dagitty()` and `dag_*()` or `node_*()` functions to change the underlying data frame.
Similarly, the quick plotting functions use ggdag's geoms to visualize the resulting DAG(s).
In other words, you can use the same data manipulation and visualization strategies that you use day-to-day directly with ggdag.

Here's a condensed version of what `ggdag_adjustment_set()` is doing:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 4.5
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-align: center
podcast_dag_tidy |> 
  # add adjustment sets to data
  dag_adjustment_sets() |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend,
    color = adjusted, shape = adjusted
  )) + 
  # ggdag's custom geoms: add nodes, edges, and labels
  geom_dag_point() + 
  # remove adjusted paths
  geom_dag_edges_link(data = \(.df) filter(.df, adjusted != "adjusted")) + 
  geom_dag_label_repel() + 
  # you can use any ggplot function, too
  facet_wrap(~ set) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(adjusted = 15, unadjusted = 19))
```
:::

Minimal adjustment sets are only one type of valid adjustment sets.
Sometimes, there are other combinations of variables that can get us an unbiased effect estimate.
Two other options available in ggdag are full adjustment sets and canonical adjustment sets.
Full adjustment sets are are every combination of variables that result in a valid set.

```{r}
#| label: fig-adustment-set-all
#| fig-width: 6.5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center
ggdag_adjustment_set(
  podcast_dag, 
  text = FALSE, 
  use_labels = "label",
  # get full adjustment sets
  type = "all"
)
```

It turns out that we can also control for `humor` without biasing the result.

Canonical adjusment sets are a bit more complex: they are all possible ancestors of the exposure and outcome minus any possible descendants.
In fully saturated DAGs (DAGs where every node causes anything that comes after it in time), the canonical adjustment set is the minimal adjustment set.

::: callout-tip
Most of the functions in ggdag use dagitty underneath the hood.
It's often useful to call dagitty functions directly.

```{r}
adjustmentSets(podcast_dag, type = "canonical")
```
:::

Using our proposed DAG, let's simulate some data to see how accounting for the minimal adjustment set might occur in practice.

```{r}
set.seed(10)
sim_data <- podcast_dag |>
  simulate_data()
```

```{r}
sim_data
```

Since we have simulated this data, we know that this is a case where *standard methods will succeed* (see @sec-standard) and therefore can estimate the causal effect using a basic linear regression model.
@fig-dag-sim shows a forest plot of the simulated data based on our DAG.
Notice the model that only included the exposure resulted in a spurious effect (an estimate of -0.1 when we know the truth is 0), whereas the model that adjusted for the two variables as suggested by `ggdag_adjustment_set()` is not spurious (0.0).

```{r}
#| label: fig-dag-sim
#| fig-cap: "Forest plot of simulated data based on the DAG described in @fig-dag-podcast"
## Model that does not close backdoor paths
unadjusted_model <- lm(exam ~ podcast, sim_data) |>
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  dplyr::filter(term == "podcast") |>
  mutate(formula = "podcast")

## Model that closes backdoor paths
adjusted_model <- lm(exam ~ podcast + mood + prepared, sim_data) |>
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) |>
  dplyr::filter(term == "podcast") |>
  mutate(formula = "podcast + mood + prepared")

  unadjusted_model,
  adjusted_model
) |>

  geom_pointrange(fatten = 3, size = 1) +
  theme_minimal(18) +
  labs(
    y = NULL,
    caption = "correct effect size: 0"
  )
```

## Structures of Causality

### Advanced Confounding

In `podcast_dag`, `mood` and `prepared` were *direct* confounders: there was an arrow going directly from them to `podcast` and `exam`. Often, backdoor paths are more complex. Let's consider such a case by adding two new variables: `alertness` and `skills_course`. `alertness` represents the feeling of alertness from a good mood, thus the arrow going from `mood` to `alertness`. `skills_course` represents whether the student took a College Skills Course and learned time management techniques. Now, `skills_course` is what frees up the time to listen to a podcast as well as being prepared for the exam. `mood` and `prepared` are no longer direct confounders: they are two variables along a more complex backdoor path. Additionally, we've added an arrow going from `humor` to `mood`. Let's take a look.

```{r}
podcast_dag2 <- dagify(
    podcast ~ mood + humor + skills_course,
    alertness ~ mood,
    mood ~ humor,
    prepared ~ skills_course,
    exam ~ alertness + prepared,
    coords = time_ordered_coords(),
    exposure = "podcast",
    outcome = "exam",
    labels = c(
        podcast = "podcast",
        exam = "exam score",
        mood = "mood",
        alertness = "alertness",
        skills_course = "college\nskills course",
        humor = "humor",
        prepared = "prepared"
    )
)

ggdag(podcast_dag2, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
paths <- paths(podcast_dag2)
open_paths <- glue::glue_collapse(glue::glue('`{paths$paths[paths$open]}`'), sep = ", ", last = ", and")
adj_sets <- unclass(adjustmentSets(podcast_dag2)) |> map_chr(\(.x) glue::glue('{unlist(glue::glue_collapse(.x, sep = " + "))}'))
adj_sets <- glue::glue("`{adj_sets}`")
```

Now there are *three* backdoor paths we need to close: `r open_paths`. 

```{r}
ggdag_paths(podcast_dag2, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE, shadow = TRUE)
```

There are `r length(adjustmentSets(podcast_dag2))` to close all three paths (and `r length(adjustmentSets(podcast_dag2, type = "all"))` full adjustment sets!). The minimal adjustment sets are `r adj_sets`. We can now block the open paths in several ways. `mood` and `prepared` still work, but we've got other options, now. Notably, `prepared` and `alertness` could happen at the same time or even after `podcast`. `skills_course` and `mood` still happen before both `podcast` and `exam`, so the idea is still the same: the confounding pathway starts before the exposure and outcome. 

```{r}
ggdag_adjustment_set(podcast_dag2, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

Deciding between these adjustment sets is a matter of judgment: if all data are perfectly measured, the DAG is correct, and we've modeled them correctly, then it doesn't matter which we use. Each adjustment set will result in an unbiased estimate. All three of those assumptions are usually untrue to some degree. Let's consider the path via `skills_course` and `prepared`. It may be that we are better able to assess whether or not someone took the College Skills Course than how prepared for the exam they are. In that case, an adjustment set with `skills_course` is a better option. But perhaps we better understand the relationship between preparedness and exam results. If we have it measured, controlling for that might be better. We could get the best of both worlds by including both variables: between the better measurement of `skills_course` and the better modeling of `prepared`, we might have a better chance of minimizing confounding from this path. 

### Selection Bias and Mediation

Selection bias is another name for the type of bias that is induced by adjusting for a collider. It's called "selection bias" because a common form of collider-induced bias is a variable that is inherently stratified upon by the design of the study. Let's consider a case based on the original `podcast_dag` but with one additional variable: whether or not the student showed up to the exam. Now there is an indirect effect of `podcast` on `exam`: listening to a podcast influences whether or not the students showed up for the exam. The true result of `exam` is missing for those who didn't show up; by studying the group of people who *did* show up, we are inherently stratifying on this variable.

```{r}
podcast_dag3 <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared + showed_up,
  showed_up ~ podcast + mood + prepared,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(
    list(
      # time point 1
      c("prepared", "humor", "mood"), 
      # time point 2
      "podcast",  
      "showed_up",  
      # time point 3
      "exam"
    )
  ),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "mood",
    humor = "humor",
    prepared = "prepared",
    showed_up = "showed up"
  )
)
ggdag(podcast_dag3, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

The problem is that `showed_up` is both a collider and a mediator: stratifying on it induces a relationship between many of the variables in the DAG but blocks the the indirect effect of `podcast` on `exam`. Luckily, the adjustment sets can take care of the first problem; because `showed_up` happens *before* `exam`, we're less at risk of collider bias between the exposure and outcome. Unfortunately, we no have no way to calculate the total effect of `podcast` on `exam` because part of the effect is missing: the indirect effect is closed at `showed_up`.

```{r}
podcast_dag3 |> 
  adjust_for("showed_up") |> 
  ggdag_adjustment_set()
```

Sometimes, you can still estimate effects in this situation by changing the estimate you wish to calculate. We can't calculate the total effect because we are missing the indirect effect, but we can still calculate the direct effect of `podcast` on `exam`.

```{r}
podcast_dag3 |> 
  adjust_for("showed_up") |> 
  ggdag_adjustment_set(effect = "direct")
```

#### M-Bias and Butterfly Bias

A special case of selection bias that you'll often see people talk about is *M-bias*. It's called M-bias because it looks like an M when arranges top to bottom.

```{r}
m_bias() |> 
  ggdag()
```

::: callout-tip
ggdag has a number of quick-DAGs for demonstrating basic causal structures including `confounder_triangle()`, `collider_triangle()`, `m_bias()`, and `butterfly_bias()`.
:::

What's theoretically interesting about M-bias is that `m` is a collider but occurs before `x` and `y`. Remember that association is blocked at a collider, so there is no open path between `x` and `y`.

```{r}
paths(m_bias())
```

Let's focus on the `mood` path of the podcast-exam DAG. What if we were wrong about mood, and the actual relationship was M-shaped? Let's say that, rather than causing `podcast` and `exam`, mood was itself caused by two mutual causes of `podcast` and `exam`, `u1` and `u2`. We don't know what `u1` and `u2` are, and we don't have them measured. As above, there are no open paths in this subset of the DAG.

```{r}
podcast_dag4 <- dagify(
  podcast ~ u1,
  exam ~ u2,
  mood ~ u1 + u2,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(list(
    c("u1", "u2"),
    "mood",
    "podcast", 
    "exam"
  )),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "mood",
    u1 = "unmeasured",
    u2 = "unmeasured"
  ),
  # we don't have them measured
  latent = c("u1", "u2")
)

ggdag(podcast_dag4, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

The problem arises when we think our original DAG is the right DAG: `mood` is in the adjustment set, so we control for it. But this induces bias! It opens up a path between `u1` and `u2`, thus creating a path from `podcast` to `exam`. If we had either `u1` or `u2` measured, we could adjust for them to close this path, but we don't. There's no way to close this open path. 

```{r}
podcast_dag4 |> 
  adjust_for("mood") |> 
  ggdag_adjustment_set(use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

Of course, the best thing to do here is not control for `mood` at all. Sometimes, though, that is not an option. Imagine if, instead of `mood`, this turned out to be the real structure for `showed_up`: since we are inherently controlling for `showed_up`, and we don't have the unmeasured variables, our study results will always be biased. It's important to understand if we're in that situation so we can address it with sensitivity analysis to understand just how biased the effect would be.

Let's consider a variation on M-bias where `mood` causes `podcast` and `exam` and `u1` and `u2` are mutual causes of `mood` and the exposure and outcome. This is sometimes called butterfly or bowtie bias, again because of its shape.

```{r}
butterfly_bias(x = "podcast", y = "exam", m = "mood", a = "u1", b = "u2") |> 
  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

Now, we're in a tough position: we need to control for `mood` because it's a confounder, but controlling for `mood` opens up the pathway from `u1` to `u2`. Because we don't have either variable measured, we can't then close the path opened from conditioning on `mood`. What should we do? It turns out that, when in doubt, controlling for `mood` is the better of the two options: confounding bias tends to be worse than collider bias, and M-shaped structures of colliders are very sensitive (e.g., a slight deviation from the M structure reduces the bias overall). 

Another common form of selection bias is from *loss to follow-up*: people drop out of a study in a way that is related to the exposure and outcome. We'll come back to this topic in @sec-TODO.

### Causes of the exposure, causes of the outcome

Let's consider one other type of causal structure that's important: causes of the exposure and not the outcome, and their opposites, causes of the outcome and not the exposure. Let's add a variable, `grader_mood`, to the original DAG.

```{r}
podcast_dag5 <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared + grader_mood,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(
    list(
      # time point 1
      c("prepared", "humor", "mood"), 
      # time point 2
      c("podcast", "grader_mood"),  
      # time point 3
      "exam"
    )
  ),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "student\nmood",
    humor = "humor",
    prepared = "prepared",
    grader_mood = "grader\nmood"
  )
)
ggdag(podcast_dag5, use_labels = "label", text = FALSE)
```

There are now two variables that aren't related to *both* the exposure and the outcome: `humor`, which causes `podcast` but not `exam`, and `grader_mood`, which causes `exam` but not `podcast`. Let's start with `humor`.

Variables that cause the exposure but not the outcome are also called *instrumental variables* (IVs). IVs are an unusual circumstance where, under certain conditions, controlling for them can make other types of bias worse. What's unusual about this is that IVs can *also* be used to conduct an entirely different approach to estimating an unbiased effect of the exposure on the outcome. IVs are commonly used this way in econometrics and are increasingly popular in other areas. In short, IV analysis allows us to estimate the causal effect using a different set of assumptions than the approaches we've talked about thus far. Sometimes, a problem that is intractible using propensity score methods is possible to address using IVs and vice versa. We'll talk more about IVs in @sec-TODO.

So, if you're *not* using IV methods, should you include an IV in a model meant to address confounding? If you're not sure if the variable is an IV or not, you should probably add it to your model: it's more likely to be a confounder than an IV, and, it turns out, the bias from adding an IV is usually small in practice. So, like adjusting for a potential M-structure variable, the risk of bias is worse from confounding.

Now let's talk about the opposite of an IV: a cause of the outcome that is not the cause of the exposure. These variables are sometimes called *competing exposures* (because they also cause the outcome) or *precision variables* (because, as we'll see, the increase the precision of causal estimates). We'll call them precision variables because we're concerned about the relationship to the research question at hand, not to another research question where they are exposures.

Like IVs, precision variables do not occur along paths from the exposure to the outcome. Thus, including them is not necessary. Unlike IVs, including precision variables is beneficial. Including other causes of the outcomes helps a statistical model capture some of its variation. This doesn't impact the point estimate of the effect, but it does reduce the variance, resulting in smaller standard errors and narrower confidence intervals. Thus, we recommend including them when possible.

So, even though we don't need to control for `grader_mood`, if we have it in the data set, we should. Similarly, `humor` is not a good addition to the model unless we think it really might be a confounder; if it is a true instrument, we might want to consider using IV methods to estimate the effect, instead.

### Measurement Error and Missingness

DAGs can also help us understand the bias that can arise from mismeasurements in the data, including the worse mismeasurement: not measuring it at all. We'll cover these topics in [Chapter -@sec-TODO-missingness], but the basic idea is that by separating the true value from the observed value, we can better understand how such biases may behave. Here's a basic example of a type of bias called *recall bias*. Recall bias is when the outcome influences a participant's memory of exposure, so it's a particular problem in retrospective studies where the earlier exposure is not recorded until after the outcome happens. An example of when this can occur is a case-control study of cancer. Someone *with* cancer may be more motivated to ruminate on their past exposures than someone *without* cancer. So, their memory about a given exposure may be more refined than someone without. By conditioning on the observed version of the exposure, we open up a many collider paths. Unfortunately, there is no way to close them all. If this is the case, then we need to ask how severe the bias would be in practice.

```{r}
error_dag <- dagify(
  exposure_observed ~ exposure_real + exposure_error,
  outcome_observed ~ outcome_real + outcome_error,
  outcome_real ~ exposure_real,
  exposure_error ~ outcome_real,
  labels = c(
    exposure_real = "Exposure\n(truth)",
    exposure_error = "Measurement Error\n(exposure)",
    exposure_observed = "Exposure\n(observed)",
    outcome_real = "Outcome\n(truth)",
    outcome_error = "Measurement Error\n(outcome)",
    outcome_observed = "Outcome\n(observed)"
  ),
  exposure = "exposure_real",
  outcome = "outcome_real",
  coords = time_ordered_coords()
)

error_dag |> 
  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

## Recommendations in building DAGs

In principle, using DAGs is easy: you specify the causal relationships you think exist and then query the DAG for information like valid adjustment sets. In practice, assembling DAGs takes considerable time and thought. In fact, next to defining the research question itself, it's one of the hardest steps in making causal inferences. Very little guidance exists on best practices in assembling DAGs. @Tennant2021 collected data on DAGs in applied health research to better understand how they were being used. @tbl-dag-properties shows some information they collected: the median number of nodes and arcs in a DAG, their ration, the saturation percent of the DAG, and how many were fully saturated. Saturating DAGs means adding all possible arrows going forward in time, e.g. in a fully saturated DAG, any given variable at time point 1 has arrows going to all variables in future time points, and so on. Most DAGs were only about half saturated and very few were fully saturated. 

Only about half of the papers using DAGs reported the adjustment set used. In other words, researchers presented their assumptions about the research question but not the implications about how they should handle the modeling stage or if in fact they did use a valid adjustment set. Similarly, the majority of studies did not report the estimand of interest.

::: {.callout-note} 
The estimand is the target of interest in terms of what it is we're trying to estimate, as discussed briefly in [Chapter -@sec-whole-game]. We'll discuss estimands in detail in [Chapter -@sec-estimands].

    ratio ~ "Node to Arc Ratio",

    reported_estimand ~ "Reported Estimand",
    report_adjset ~ "Reported Adjustment Set"

    label = md("**Reporting**"),
    rows = 8:13,
    id = "reporting"
  ) |> 
  row_group_order(c("dag_prop", "reporting"))
```

In this section, we'll offer some advice from @Tennant2021 and our own experience assembling DAGs.

### Iterate early and often

One of the best things you can do for the quality of your results is to make the DAG before you conduct the study, ideally before you even collect the data. If you're already working with your data, at minimum build your DAG prior to doing data analysis. This advice is similar in spirit to pre-registered analysis plans: declaring your assumptions ahead of time can help clarify what you need to do, reduce risk of overfitting (e.g., determining confounders incorrectly from the data), and give you time to get feedback on your DAG.

This last benefit is particularly important: you should ideally democratize your DAG. Share it early and often with others who are experts on the data, domain, and models. It's natural to create a DAG, present it to your colleagues, and realize you have missed something important. Sometimes you won't agree on every detail of the structure. That's a good thing: you know now where there is uncertainty in your DAG. You can then examine the results from more than one plausible DAG or address the uncertainty with sensitivity analyses.

If you have more than one candidate DAG, it might be useful to check their adjustment sets. If two DAGs have overlapping adjustment sets, focus on those sets; then, you can move forward in a way that satisfies the plausible assumptions you have.  

### Consider your question

As we saw in @fig-COLLIDER-MEDIATION-TODO, some questions can be difficult to answer with certain data, while others are more approachable. You should consider exactly what it is you want to estimate. This is an important topic and the subject of [Chapter -@sec-estimands].

Another important detail about how your DAG relates to your question is the population and time. Many causal structures are not static over time and space. Consider lung cancer: the distribution of causes of lung cancer was considerably different before the spread of smoking. In medieval Japan, prior to the spread of tobacco from the Americas centuries later, the causal structure for lung cancer would have been practically different to what it is in Japan today, both in terms of tobacco use and other factors (age of the population, etc.) 

The same is true for confounders. Even if something *can* cause the exposure and outcome, if the prevalence of that thing is zero in the population you're analyzing, it's irrelevant to the causal question. It may also be that, in some populations, it doesn't affect one of the two. The reverse is, of course, also true: there might be something unique to the target population. The use of tobacco in North America several centuries ago was unique among the world population, even though ceremonial tobacco use was quite different from modern recreational use. Many changes won't happen as dramatically as across centuries, but sometimes, they do, e.g. if regulation in one country effectively eliminates the population exposure to something.

### Order nodes by time {#chapter-05-sec-time-ordered}

As we discussed earlier, we recommend ordering your variables by time, either left-to-right or up-to-down. There are two reasons for this. First, time ordering is an important part of your assumptions. After all, something happening before another thing is a requirement for it to be a cause. Thinking this through carefully will clarify your DAG and the variables you need to address. 

Second, after a certain level of complexity, it's easier to read a DAG when it is arranged by time because you have to think less about that dimension; it's inherent to the layout. The time ordering algorithm in ggdag automates much of this for you, although as we saw earlier, it's sometimes helpful to give it more information about the order.

A related topic is feedback loops. Often we think about two things that mutually cause each other as happening in a circle, like global warming and A/C use (A/C use increases global warming, which makes it hotter, which increases A/C use, and so on). It's tempting to visualize that relationship like this:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 3.5
#| fig-height: 3.5
dagify(
  ac_use ~ global_temp,
  global_temp ~ ac_use,
  labels = c(ac_use = "A/C use", global_temp = "Global\ntemperature")
) |> 
  ggdag(layout = "circle", edge_type = "arc", text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

From a DAG perspective, this is a problem because of the *A* part of *DAG*: it's cyclic! Importantly, though, it's also not correct from a causal perspective. Feedback loops are a shorthand for what really happens, which is that the two variables mutually affect each other *over time*. Causality only goes forward in time, so it doesn't make since for it to go back and forth like in @fig-TODO.

The real DAG looks something like this:

```{r}
dagify(
  global_temp_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,
  ac_use_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,
  global_temp_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,
  ac_use_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,
  global_temp_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,
  ac_use_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(),
  labels = c(
    ac_use_1990 = "A/C use\n(1990)", 
    global_temp_1990 = "Global\ntemperature\n(1990)",
    ac_use_2000 = "A/C use\n(2000)", 
    global_temp_2000 = "Global\ntemperature\n(2000)",
    ac_use_2010 = "A/C use\n(2010)", 
    global_temp_2010 = "Global\ntemperature\n(2010)",
    ac_use_2020 = "A/C use\n(2020)", 
    global_temp_2020 = "Global\ntemperature\n(2020)"
  )
) |> 
  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```
The two variables, rather than being in a feed*back* loop are actually in a feed*forward* loop: they co-evolve over time. Here, we only show four discrete moments in time (the decades from 1990 to 2020), but of course we could get much finer depending on the question and data. 

As with any DAG, the right analysis approach depends on the question. The effect of A/C use in 2000 on global temperature in 2020 produces a different adjustment set than the global temperature in 2000 on A/C use in 2020. Similarly, whether we also model this change over time or just those two time points depends on the question. Often, these types of feedforward relationships require you to address *time-varying* confounding, which we'll discuss in @sec-TODO.

### Consider the whole data collection process

As @fig-TODO showed us, it's important to consider the *way* we collected data as much as the causal structure of the question at hand. This is particularly true if you're working with "found" data---a data set not intentionally collected to answer the research question. We are always inherently conditioning on the data we have vs. the data we don't have. If the data collection process was influenced by other variables in the causal structure, you need to consider what the effect is. Do you need to control for additional variables? Do you need to change the effect you are trying to estimate? Can you answer the question at all?

<!-- Let's consider an example: workers at a factory are potentially exposed to something (e.g., a carcinogenic) that may increase their risk of dying. Some workers are exposed, and some are not. The problem is that exposure *prior* to the study resulted in only those healthy enough to work being present at the start of the study. If there is another factor, say some important aspect of the worker's health, that also contributes to whether or not they are at work, we have selection bias. We are inherently stratifying on whether or not someone is at work. -->

## What about case-control studies? 

A common study design in epidemiology is the case-control study. Case-control studies are particularly useful when the outcome under study is rare or take a very long time to happen (like many types of cancer). Participants are selected into the study based on their outcome: once a person has an event, the are entered as a case and matched with a control who hasn't had the event. Often, they are matched on other factors as well.

Matched case-control studies are selection biased by design. In @fig-TODO, when we condition on selection into the study, we lose the ability to close all backdoor paths, even if we control for `confounder`. From the DAG, it would appear that the entire design is invalid!

```{r}
dagify(
  outcome ~ confounder + exposure,
  selection ~ outcome + confounder,
  exposure ~ confounder,
  exposure = "exposure",
  outcome = "outcome",
  coords = time_ordered_coords()
) |> 
  ggdag(edge_type = "arc", text_size = 2.2)
```

Luckily, this isn't completely true. Case-control studies are limited in the type of causal effects they can estimate (causal odds ratios, which under some circumstances approximate causal risk ratios). With careful study design and sampling, the math works out such that these estimates are still valid. Exactly how and why case-control studies work are beyond the scope of this book, but they are a remarkably clever design.

### Include variables you don't have

It's critical that you include *all* variables important to the causal structure, not just they variables you have measured in your data. ggdag can mark variables as unmeasured ("latent"); it will then return only useable adjustment sets, e.g., those without the unmeasured variables. Of course, the best thing to do is to use DAGs to help you understand what to measure in the first place, but there are many reasons why that might not be the case for your data. Even data that was intentionally collected for the research question might not have a variable that was discovered to be a confounder after data collection.

For instance, if we have a DAG where `exposure` and `outcome` have a confounding pathway consisting of `confounder1` and `confounder2`, we can control for either to succesfully debias the estimate:

```{r}
dagify(
  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,
  exposure ~ confounder2,
  confounder2 ~ confounder1,
  exposure = "exposure",
  outcome = "outcome"
) |> 
  adjustmentSets()
```

Thus, if just one is missing (`latent`), then we are ok:

```{r}
dagify(
  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,
  exposure ~ confounder2,
  confounder2 ~ confounder1,
  exposure = "exposure",
  outcome = "outcome",
  latent = "confounder1"
) |> 
  adjustmentSets()
```

But if both are missing, there are no valid adjustment sets.

When you don't have a variable measured, you still have a few options. As mentioned above, you may be able to identify alternate adjustment sets. If the missing variable is required to completely close all backdoor paths, you can and should conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of not having it. This is the subject of [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity]. 

Under some lucky circumstances, you can also use a *proxy* confounder. A proxy confounder is a variable that is closely related to the confounder such that controlling for it controls for some of the effect of the missing variable. Consider an expansion of the basic confounding relationship where `q` has a cause, `p`. Technically, if we don't have `q`, we can't close the backdoor path and our effect will be biased. Practically, though, if `p` is highly correlated with `q`, it can serve as a method to reduce the confounding from `q`. You can think of `p` as a mismeasured version of `q`; it will almost never completely control for the biased via `q`, but it can help minimize it.

```{r}
dagify(
  y ~ x + q,
  x ~ q,
  q ~ p,
  coords = time_ordered_coords()
) |> 
  ggdag(edge_type = "arc")
```

### Saturate your DAG then prune

In discussing @tbl-TODO, we mentioned *saturated* DAGs. These are DAGs where all possible arrows are included based on the time-ordering, e.g. every variable causes variables that come after it in time.

*Not* including an arrow is a bigger assumption than including one. In other words, your default should be to include an arrow from one variable to a future variable. This is counter intuitive to many people. How can it be that we need to be so careful about assessing causal effects yet be so liberal in applying causal assumptions in the DAG? The answer to this lies in the strength and prevalence of the cause. Technically, an arrow present means that *for at least a single observation*, the prior node causes the following node. The arrow similarly says nothing about the strength of the relationship. So, a minuscule causal effect on a single individual justifies the presence of an arrow. Of course, in practice, such a case is probably not relevant. There is *effectively* no arrow. 

The larger point, though, is that you should not feel hesitant to add an arrow. The bar for justification is much lower than you might think. Instead, it's helpful to 1) determine your time ordering 2) saturate the DAG then 3) prune out implausible arrows.

Let's experiment by working through a saturated version of the podcast-exam DAG. 

First, the time-ordering. Presumably, the student's sense of humor far predates the day of the exam. Mood in the morning, too, predates listening to the podcast or exam score, as does preparation. The saturated DAG given this ordering is:

```{r}
podcast_dag_sat <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared + humor,
  prepared ~ humor,
  mood ~ humor,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(
    list(
      "humor",
      c("prepared", "mood"), 
      "podcast",  
      "exam"
    )
  ),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "mood",
    humor = "humor",
    prepared = "prepared"
  )
)

# TODO echo: false this and customize the arc for humor to exam
ggdag(podcast_dag_sat, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```
There are a few new arrows here. Humor now causes the other two confounders, as well as exam score. Some of them make sense. Sense of humor probably affects mood for some people. What about preparedness? This seems a little less plausible. Similarly, we know sense of humor is not affecting exam score because the grading is blinded. Let's prune those two.

```{r}
podcast_dag_pruned <- dagify(
  podcast ~ mood + humor + prepared,
  exam ~ mood + prepared,
  mood ~ humor,
  coords = time_ordered_coords(
    list(
      "humor",
      c("prepared", "mood"), 
      "podcast",  
      "exam"
    )
  ),
  exposure = "podcast",
  outcome = "exam",
  labels = c(
    podcast = "podcast",
    exam = "exam score",
    mood = "mood",
    humor = "humor",
    prepared = "prepared"
  )
)

# TODO echo: false this and customize the arc for humor to exam
ggdag(podcast_dag_pruned, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label")
```

This seems a little more reasonable. So, was our original DAG wrong? That depends on a number of factors. Importantly, both DAGs produce the same adjustment set: controlling for `mood` and `prepared` will give us an unbiased effect if either DAG is correct. Even if the new DAG were to produce a different adjustment set, whether it the result is meaningfully different depends on the strength of the confounding. 

### Include instruments and precision variables

Technically, you do not need to include instrumental and precision variables in your DAG. The adjustment sets will be the same with and without them. However, adding them is important for two reasons. Firstly, they demonstrate your assumptions about the relationships between them and the variables under study. As we discussed above, *not* including an arrow is a bigger assumption than including one, so it's useful information about how you think the causal structure operates. Secondly, it impacts your modeling decision. You should always include precision variables in your model to reduce variability in your estimate, so it helps you identify those. Instruments are also useful to see because they may guide alternative or complementary modeling strategies, as we'll discuss in @sec-TODO-triangulation.  

### Focus on the causal structure, then consider measurement bias

As we saw above, missingness and measurement error can be a source of bias. As we'll see in [Chapter -@sec-TODO-missingness], we have a number of strategies to approach such a situation. Yet, most everything we measure is inaccurate to some degree. The true DAG for the data at hand inherently conditions on the measured version of variables. In that since, your data are always subtly wrong, a sort of unreliable narrator. So, when should we include this information in the DAG? We recommend first focusing on the causal structure of the DAG as if you had perfectly measured each variable. Then, think through how mismeasurement and missingness might affect the realized data, particularly as they relate to the exposure, outcome, and key confounders. You may prefer to present this as an alternative DAG to consider strategies for addressing the bias arising from those sources, e.g. imputation or sensitivity analyses. After all, the DAG in @fig-dag-measurement-error-TODO would have you think the question is unanswerable because we have no method to close all backdoor paths. As with all open paths, that depends on the severity of the bias and our ability to reckon with it.

<!-- TODO: I don't quite remember what I wanted to cover here, so revisit later to add or delete -->
<!-- ### Be accurate, but focus on clarity -->

### Pick adjustment sets most likely to be succesful

One area where measurement error is an important consideration is when picking an adjustment set. In theory, if a DAG is correct, any adjustment set will work to create an unbiased result. In practice, variables have different levels of quality. Pick an adjustment set that is most likely to succeed because contains accurate variables. Similarly, non-minimal adjustment sets are helpful to consider because together, several variables with measurement error along a backdoor path may together be enough to minimize the practical bias resulting from that path.

What if you don't have certain key variables measured and thus do not have a valid adjustment set? In that case, you should pick the adjustment set with the best chance of minimizing the bias from other backdoor paths. All is not lost if you don't have every confounder measured: get the highest quality estimate you can, then conduct a sensitivity analysis about the unmeasured variables to understand the impact.

### Use robustness checks

Finally, we recommend checking your DAG for robustness. You can never truly verify the correctness of your DAG under most conditions, but you can use the implications in your DAG to support it. There are three types of robustness checks that can be useful depending on the circumstances. 

1. **Negative controls**. These come in two flavors: negative exposure controls and negative outcome controls. The idea is to find something associated with one but not the other, e.g. the outcome but not the exposure, such that there should be no effect. Since there should be no effect, you now have a measurement for how well you are controlling for *other* effects (e.g., the difference from null). Ideally, the set of confounders for negative controls are similar to the research question's.
2. DAG-data consistency. Negative controls are an implication of your DAG. An extension of this idea is that there are *many* such implications. Because blocking a path removes statistical dependencies from that path, you can check those assumptions in several places in your DAG.
3. Alternate adjustment sets. All things being equal, adjustment sets should give roughly the same answer because, outside of random and measurement error, they are all sets that block backdoor paths. If more than one adjustment set seems reasonable, you can use that as a sensitivity analysis by checking more than one model.

We'll discuss each of these in detail in [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity]. The caveat here is that these should be complementary to your initial DAG not a way of *replacing* it. In fact, if you use more than one adjustment set during the course of your analysis, you should report the results from all of them to avoid overfitting your results to your data.
