<!-- TODO:  -->
<!-- -   Probably too long, but if possible, condense to a popout -->
<!-- -   DAGs showing examples where prediction can lean on measured confounders, colliders. It's the amount of information a variable brings, not whether the coeffecient is unbiased affect of variable on outcome. -->
<!-- -   Not practical to fit a prediction model with future variable -->
<!-- -   Table 2 Bias examples. Unmeasure confounding of Z-Y relationship. Mediation example. -->
